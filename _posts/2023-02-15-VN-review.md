## The Structure
The VN96 is a mechanical keyboard that stands out in many ways. One of the most noticeable features is its knob, made from CNC aluminum alloy. This gives a satisfying touch while knobing around, enhancing the overall user experience.

Inside the keyboard, thereâ€™s a steel plate that forms the backbone of its structure. This is complemented by a silicone de-noise bottom pad and a PORON switch pad. These features work together to provide noise cancellation, ensuring a full, resonant sound while typing.

The VN96 offers versatile connectivity options. It can be connected via Bluetooth 5.0 and 2.4GHz wireless connection, powered by a 6,000 mAh battery. Alternatively, it can be connected using a Type-C USB cable. For those who enjoy a bit of flair, the keyboard is RGB-ready and offers a few effects to choose from.

When it comes to the keycaps, I personally use XDA profile keycaps made from thick PBT material. They offer a soft touch while typing, adding to the overall comfort and ease of use.

## The Switches
As a former heavy gamer, I always preferred light red switches. However, as I transitioned to more typing and less gaming, I found black switches to be more suitable. I didnâ€™t want to settle for cheap Outemu switches, so I opted for the Milky Gateron blacks. They are somewhat heavier than I was expecting, but they turned out to be the right choice for me at this point.

The sound these switches produce is truly amazing. Itâ€™s really thocky and full, providing a very satisfying typing experience, especially during long typing sessions.



I highly recommend lubing the switches as they come unlubed from the factory. Lubing makes a huge difference in sound. If youâ€™re not planning to lube them, I would say donâ€™t bother to purchase it. Stick with your Redragon keyboard; otherwise, youâ€™re missing out on a truly premium experience.


## Sound Test

So i decided to make a short video for the typing sound, let me know what you think.

## Summary
I will highly recommend buying this bone, with the suggested parts I use, especially if you are a heavy typer with fat fingers like me. Don't be afraid to build it on your own, super easy I can help if needed, just send me a message on any platform ðŸ˜Š
