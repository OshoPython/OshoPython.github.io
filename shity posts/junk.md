As we delve into the intricate patterns of hydrological events, The results between the data presented here to the fitting distributions, showcasing short but intense storms with high precipitation rates, of rainfall occurrences in the last 5-years. This calls for a heightened awareness of the potential consequences that await us in the future.
As we navigate these challenges, It seems there alot of understanding to interconnectedness between the rising temperatures [[2]](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20Earth%20was%20about%202.45,change%20in%20global%20surface%20temperatures.), shifting weather patterns, and hydrological events becomes paramount. In essence, the data serves not only as a record of the past but as a compass guiding us toward informed decisions for a more resilient future. It is our collective responsibility to address the implications of extreme rain events and strive for a harmonious coexistence with our ever-evolving environment. On my next posts, I will look at some of the temperature data and the correlation with extreme rain events.
