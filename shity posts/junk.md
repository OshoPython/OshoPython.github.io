As we delve into the intricate patterns of hydrological events, The results between the data presented here to the fitting distributions, showcasing short but intense storms with high precipitation rates, of rainfall occurrences in the last 18-years. This calls for a heightened awareness of the potential consequences that await us in the future.
As we navigate these challenges, It seems there alot more of understanding to explore with the interconnectedness between the rising temperatures [[2]](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20Earth%20was%20about%202.45,change%20in%20global%20surface%20temperatures.) to those extreme rain events that suddenly occouerd in the last few years. In essence, the data serves not only as a record of the past but as a compass guiding us toward informed decisions for a more resilient future. It is our collective responsibility to address the implications of extreme rain events and strive for a harmonious coexistence with our ever-evolving environment. On my next posts, I will look at some of the temperature data and the correlation with extreme rain events.

## Conclusions
As we delve into the intricate patterns of hydrological events, it’s impossible to ignore the broader context of our changing climate. The rising average temperatures, evident in recent years, play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of our hydrological systems. The results between the data presented here to the fitting distributions, showcasing short but intense storms with high precipitation rates, and the escalating temperatures is a stark reminder of the intricate dance between atmospheric conditions and hydrological responses [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-20-0938.1).
The warming trend observed in our climate amplifies the risk of extreme weather events, exemplified by the surge in high-intensity rainfall occurrences in the last 5-years. This calls for a heightened awareness of the potential consequences that await us in the future. As we navigate these challenges, understanding the interconnectedness of rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and hydrological events becomes paramount.
In essence, the data serves not only as a record of the past but as a compass guiding us toward informed decisions for a more resilient future. It is our collective responsibility to address the implications of climate change and strive for a harmonious coexistence with our ever-evolving environment. On my next posts, I will look at some of the temperature data and the correlation with extreme rain events.



# My Experience with the VN96 Mechanical Keyboard
## The Structure
The VN96 is a mechanical keyboard that stands out in many ways. One of the most noticeable features is its knob, made from CNC aluminum alloy. This gives a satisfying touch while knobing around, enhancing the overall user experience.

Inside the keyboard, there’s a steel plate that forms the backbone of its structure. This is complemented by a silicone de-noise bottom pad and a PORON switch pad. These features work together to provide noise cancellation, ensuring a full, resonant sound while typing.

The VN96 offers versatile connectivity options. It can be connected via Bluetooth 5.0 and 2.4GHz wireless connection, powered by a 6,000 mAh battery. Alternatively, it can be connected using a Type-C USB cable. For those who enjoy a bit of flair, the keyboard is RGB-ready and offers a few effects to choose from.

When it comes to the keycaps, I personally use XDA profile keycaps made from thick PBT material. They offer a soft touch while typing, adding to the overall comfort and ease of use.

## The Switches
As a former heavy gamer, I always preferred light red switches. However, as I transitioned to more typing and less gaming, I found black switches to be more suitable. I didn’t want to settle for cheap Outemu switches, so I opted for the Milky Gateron blacks. They are somewhat heavier than I was expecting, but they turned out to be the right choice for me at this point.

The sound these switches produce is truly amazing. It’s really Thocky and full, providing a very satisfying typing experience, especially during long typing sessions.

I highly recommend lubing the switches as they come unlubed from the factory. Lubing makes a huge difference in sound. If you’re not planning to lube them, I would say don’t bother to purchase it. Stick with your Redragon keyboard; otherwise, you’re missing out on a truly premium experience.

## Summary
I will highly recomend to buy this bone, with the suggested parts I use, specialyl if you a heavy typer with fat fingers like me.
